The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
2. Names must begin with a letter
3. Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
4. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
5. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
