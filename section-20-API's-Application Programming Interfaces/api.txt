Defn: a set of functions, commands, protocols and objects that programmers can use to create software or interct with an external system.


Endpoints: An API endpoint is a point at which an API -- the code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other -- connects with the software program.
eg: https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/


Paths: A Path is a unit of a REST API that you can call. A Path comprises an HTTP verb and a URL path that, when exposed, is combined with the base path of the API.
eg: https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming   //Programming is the path


Parameters: API parameters are the variable parts of a resource. They determine the type of action you want to take on the resource. Each parameter has a name, value type ad optional description.
eg: https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming?contains=debugging  //?contains=debugging is the parameter


Authentication: The API authentication process validates the identity of the client attempting to make a connection by using an authentication protocol. The protocol sends the credentials from the remote client requesting the connection to the remote access server in either plain text or encrypted form.
eg: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Thane&units=metric&appid=e31608f1dc6ef3a34e1c14e385b576a5  //appid=e31608f1dc6ef3a34e1c14e385b576a5  is the authentication
